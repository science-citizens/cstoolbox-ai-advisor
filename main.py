    instruction = '''🛠️This tool helps you find information about methods, tools, and best practices for water-related citizen science.  
    🔎For example, try asking it questions about how to setup a water quality monitoring initiative, how to find participants for your activity, or what projects already exist for monitoring biodiversity.  
    🧠It will search a database of curated documents for an answer to your question. Links to the documents will be provided in the answer.  
    📝For a list of documents in the database, check https://github.com/science-citizens/cstoolbox-ai-advisor. 
    🤖This tool uses an LLM, which can generate incorrect or biased responses. Feel free to use it for inspiration, but I recommend personally reading the provided sources for more reliable information.  
    🔠The model works best in English, but it can understand many other European languages if you feel more comfortable asking questions in your native tongue!  
    😞Unfortunately the chat model does not have any memory right now, so it will not remember what your previous question was. Give as much detail as possible for every question.  
    🔬This tool is still being developed!
